// TODO: Not strong opinion here, but shouldn't we namespace the actions, so is
// easier to know were an auction is defined.
//
// For example, in:
//    import { getTokenList } from 'actions'
// is difficult to know, we have to go to `actions/blockchain` without doing a
// full code search. Actually, this concrete action has nothing to do with the
// blockchain, it just checks the local storage
//
// Other alternative would be namespace it using the same structure, so, to use
// an action we can do:
//    import { blockchain: blockchainActions } from 'actions'
//    blockchainActions.getTokenList()
//
// I guess the change is very big to do it now, just I want to open a small
// discussion to get the opinions.
